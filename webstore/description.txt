Have you ever visited a website where the text is so ugly you get a headache trying to read or where the content is hard to find because of unimportant sidebars and share buttons? This extension will fix that for you.

This extension figures out what is important on a page and shows only that in the same consistent way every time.

Uses the code that powers the mobile-friendly view on phones.

Planned features:

* Font scaling support

* Multi-page article concatenation
