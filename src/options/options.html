		<p>Here you'll find various options for you to choose from. There is an
			option for changing theme and there is also an option for changing
			font. The options will truly allow you to experience DOM Distiller
			the way you want to.</p>
		<h2>Color</h2>
		<p>There are three different colors to choose from. We've got Light
			which is our most popular color. The reason for that might have
			something to do with the fact that it is the default theme.</p>
		<p>Other than Light we've also got the Dark theme. It might suit those
			who get eye strain from spending much of their time starting at
			screens</p>
		<p>Finally we've got the Sepia theme. It has a retro feel to it and
			might suit time travelers from the past.</p>
